      "primary_concern": "Wind Slabs and Wet Loose Avalanches",
      "discussion": "Upper elevation bands are experiencing moderate to strong winds at 17.7 mph, facilitating active snow transport. Leeward slopes, particularly North and East aspects, have accumulated significantly more depth (up to 76.7 cm) compared to wind-scoured West aspects, creating potential wind slab hazards. Middle elevations remain cooler with low liquid water content. Lower elevations are hovering at the freezing point (32\u00b0F) with liquid water mass reaching 1.68 on South aspects, indicating a transition toward a moist snowpack and potential for wet loose activity on solar-exposed terrain.",
      "travel_advice": "Avoid steep, wind-loaded North and East aspects at upper elevations where slabs are likely to have formed. Be cautious on South-facing slopes at lower elevations as daytime warming increases liquid water content. The safest and highest quality snow will be found on sheltered, mid-elevation slopes that have not been affected by wind scouring or solar-induced warming."

      "zone": "Swan",
      "primary_concern": "Persistent Weak Layers (Surface Hoar)",
      "discussion": "The primary instability is located at middle elevations, where a significant buried surface hoar layer (up to 1.42 mm) has been identified, resulting in a Danger Level of 3. This weak layer is present across all aspects but is most concerning on North and East slopes where the slab depth is greater. Upper elevations remain relatively stable with minimal new loading and low danger. Lower elevations show high liquid water mass (4.53) on South aspects due to temperatures near freezing, suggesting potential for point releases on steep solar slopes.",
      "travel_advice": "Exercise extreme caution and conservative terrain choices at middle elevations. Avoid steep slopes where the buried surface hoar layer may be reactive. Seek out higher elevation terrain where the snowpack is shallower and more stable, or stick to low-angle slopes. The best snow is located on high-elevation sheltered terrain where the persistent weak layer is less prevalent."

      "primary_concern": "Buried Surface Hoar and Solar Warming",
      "discussion": "At middle elevations, a buried surface hoar layer measuring 0.93 mm is the primary concern, creating a moderate avalanche risk. Snow depths are greatest on North aspects (26.7 cm), providing enough of a slab to potentially trigger the underlying weak layer. Lower elevation bands are seeing increased liquid water content, specifically on South aspects (1.93 mass), as temperatures reach 31.6\u00b0F. The upper elevation data was not available for this period, but mid-elevation trends suggest an increasingly complex snowpack structure.",
      "travel_advice": "Avoid steep mid-elevation terrain, particularly North and East aspects where buried surface hoar is most likely to be preserved under a slab. Use caution on South aspects at lower elevations during the warmest part of the day. The highest quality and safest travel will be found on low-angle, mid-elevation slopes that are sheltered from both wind and direct solar radiation."
